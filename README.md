# RAG-Application-on-Microsoft-Fabric-Azure-Open-AI
Building RAG Application on Microsoft Fabric &amp; Azure Open AI


 In this workshop, we'll demonstrate how to develop a context-aware question answering framework for any form of a document using OpenAI models, SynapseML and Azure AI Services. The source of data for this workshop is a PDF document, however, the same framework can be easily extended to other document formats too.

## Goals #
You'll learn how to:

Pre-process PDF Documents using Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Services.
Perform text chunking using SynapseML.
Generate embeddings for the chunks using SynapseML and Azure OpenAI Services.
Store the embeddings in Azure AI Search.
Build a question answering pipeline.

## Pre-requisites #
Azure account	Get a free Azure account
Microsoft Fabric License	Microsoft Fabric Licenses
A workspace in Microsoft Fabric	Create a Microsoft Fabric workspace
Access to Azure OpenAI API (optional)	Request access to Azure OpenAI
A Web browser	Get Microsoft Edge
Python knowledge	Python for beginners
Since we are using the Pre-Built Open AI Models in Microsoft Fabric you do not need to request or have access to the Azure OpenAI API. However, if you are using the trial version of Microsoft Fabric or do not have an F64+ capacity, you will need to request access to the Azure OpenAI API.
